## Summary
In this project, we are looking to find the bacteria that are grown in the test subject's belly button. The data for the subjects are in the samples.json file.
The data was used to create a bar, bubble, and gauge chart to show different information about the bacteria of each subject. The data was displayed onto the HTML
file.

To make the HTML file not look bland, style.css was used to make the background beige and add a background to the jumbotron. To make the background of the charts the same
color, in the charts.js file, the plot_bgcolor and paper_bgcolor are set to be transparent.

The following is the result of all the files in the Challenge folder. The other files are used to help learn deployment on github.
